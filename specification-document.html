<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open framework for
communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS
consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The Base
group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability that are constant
over time and across user environments, the Temporal group reflects the
characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time, and the Environmental
group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are unique to a
user's environment. The Base metrics produce a score ranging from 0 to 10, which
can then be modified by scoring the Temporal and Environmental metrics. A CVSS
score is also represented as a vector string, a compressed textual
representation of the values used to derive the score. This document provides
the official specification for CVSS version 3.1.</p>
<p>The most current CVSS resources can be found at <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">https://www.first.org/cvss/</a></p>
<p>CVSS is owned and managed by FIRST.Org, Inc. (FIRST), a US-based non-profit
organization, whose mission is to help computer security incident response teams
across the world. FIRST reserves the right to update CVSS and this document
periodically at its sole discretion. While FIRST owns all right and interest in
CVSS, it licenses it to the public freely for use, subject to the conditions
below. Membership in FIRST is not required to use or implement CVSS. FIRST does,
however, require that any individual or entity using CVSS give proper
attribution, where applicable, that CVSS is owned by FIRST and used by
permission. Further, FIRST requires as a condition of use that any individual or
entity which publishes scores conforms to the guidelines described in this
document and provides both the score and the scoring vector so others can
understand how the score was derived.</p>
<h1 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) captures the principal technical
characteristics of software, hardware and firmware vulnerabilities. Its outputs
include numerical scores indicating the severity of a vulnerability relative to
other vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>CVSS is composed of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The
Base Score reflects the severity of a vulnerability according to its intrinsic
characteristics which are constant over time and assumes the reasonable worst
case impact across different deployed environments. The Temporal Metrics adjust
the Base severity of a vulnerability based on factors that change over time,
such as the availability of exploit code. The Environmental Metrics adjust the
Base and Temporal severities to a specific computing environment. They consider
factors such as the presence of mitigations in that environment.</p>
<p>Base Scores are usually produced by the organization maintaining the vulnerable
product, or a third party scoring on their behalf. It is typical for only the
Base Metrics to be published as these do not change over time and are common to
all environments. Consumers of CVSS should supplement the Base Score with
Temporal and Environmental Scores specific to their use of the vulnerable
product to produce a severity more accurate for their organizational
environment. Consumers may use CVSS information as input to an organizational
vulnerability management process that also considers factors that are not part
of CVSS in order to rank the threats to their technology infrastructure and make
informed remediation decisions. Such factors may include: number of customers on
a product line, monetary losses due to a breach, life or property threatened, or
public sentiment on highly publicized vulnerabilities. These are outside the
scope of CVSS.</p>
<p>The benefits of CVSS include the provision of a standardized vendor and platform
agnostic vulnerability scoring methodology. It is an open framework, providing
transparency to the individual characteristics and methodology used to derive a
score.</p>
<h2 id="1-1-Metrics">1.1. Metrics</h2>
<p>CVSS is composed of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental, each
consisting of a set of metrics, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p><img src="/cvss/v3-1/media/MetricGroups.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: CVSS Metric Groups</p>
<p>The Base metric group represents the intrinsic characteristics of a
vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments. It is
composed of two sets of metrics: the Exploitability metrics and the Impact
metrics.</p>
<p>The Exploitability metrics reflect the ease and technical means by which the
vulnerability can be exploited. That is, they represent characteristics of the
<em>thing that is vulnerable</em>, which we refer to formally as the <em>vulnerable
component</em>. The Impact metrics reflect the direct consequence of a successful
exploit, and represent the consequence to the <em>thing that suffers the impact</em>,
which we refer to formally as the <em>impacted component</em>.</p>
<p>While the vulnerable component is typically a software application, module,
driver, etc. (or possibly a hardware device), the impacted component could be a
software application, a hardware device or a network resource. This potential
for measuring the impact of a vulnerability other than the vulnerable component,
was a key feature introduced with CVSS v3.0. This property is captured by the
Scope metric, discussed later.</p>
<p>The Temporal metric group reflects the characteristics of a vulnerability that
may change over time but not across user environments. For example, the presence
of a simple-to-use exploit kit would increase the CVSS score, while the creation
of an official patch would decrease it.</p>
<p>The Environmental metric group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability
that are relevant and unique to a particular user’s environment. Considerations
include the presence of security controls which may mitigate some or all
consequences of a successful attack, and the relative importance of a vulnerable
system within a technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>Each of these metrics are discussed in further detail below. The User Guide
contains scoring rubrics for the Base Metrics that may be useful when scoring.</p>
<h2 id="1-2-Scoring">1.2. Scoring</h2>
<p>When the Base metrics are assigned values by an analyst, the Base equation
computes a score ranging from 0.0 to 10.0 as illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
<p><img src="/cvss/v3-1/media/EquationsDiagram.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: CVSS Metrics and Equations</p>
<p>Specifically, the Base equation is derived from two sub equations: the
Exploitability sub-score equation, and the Impact sub-score equation. The
Exploitability sub-score equation is derived from the Base Exploitability
metrics, while the Impact sub-score equation is derived from the Base Impact
metrics.</p>
<p>The Base Score can then be refined by scoring the Temporal and Environmental
metrics in order to more accurately reflect the relative severity posed by a
vulnerability to a user’s environment at a specific point in time. Scoring the
Temporal and Environmental metrics is not required, but is recommended for more
precise scores.</p>
<p>Generally, the Base and Temporal metrics are specified by vulnerability bulletin
analysts, security product vendors, or application vendors because they
typically possess the most accurate information about the characteristics of a
vulnerability. The Environmental metrics are specified by end-user organizations
because they are best able to assess the potential impact of a vulnerability
within their own computing environment.</p>
<p>Scoring CVSS metrics also produces a vector string, a textual representation of
the metric values used to score the vulnerability. This vector string is a
specifically formatted text string that contains each value assigned to each
metric, and should always be displayed with the vulnerability score.</p>
<p>The scoring equations and vector string are explained further below.</p>
<p>Note that all metrics should be scored under the assumption that the attacker
has already located and identified the vulnerability. That is, the analyst need
not consider the means by which the vulnerability was identified. In addition,
it is likely that many different types of individuals will be scoring
vulnerabilities (e.g., software vendors, vulnerability bulletin analysts,
security product vendors), however, note that vulnerability scoring is intended
to be agnostic to the individual and their organization.</p>
<h1 id="Base-Metrics">2. Base Metrics</h1>
<h2 id="2-1-Exploitability-Metrics">2.1. Exploitability Metrics</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Exploitability metrics reflect the characteristics
of the <em>thing that is vulnerable</em>, which we refer to formally as the <em>vulnerable
component</em>. Therefore, each of the Exploitability metrics listed below should be
scored relative to the vulnerable component, and reflect the properties of the
vulnerability that lead to a successful attack.</p>
<p>When scoring Base metrics, it should be assumed that the attacker has advanced
knowledge of the weaknesses of the target system, including general
configuration and default defense mechanisms (e.g., built-in firewalls, rate
limits, traffic policing). For example, exploiting a vulnerability that results
in repeatable, deterministic success should still be considered a Low value for
Attack Complexity, independent of the attacker's knowledge or capabilities.
Furthermore, target-specific attack mitigation (e.g., custom firewall filters,
access lists) should instead be reflected in the Environmental metric scoring
group.</p>
<p>Specific configurations should not impact any attribute contributing to the CVSS
Base Score, i.e., if a specific configuration is required for an attack to
succeed, the vulnerable component should be scored assuming it is in that
configuration.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-1-Attack-Vector-AV">2.1.1. Attack Vector (AV)</h3>
<p>This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is
possible. This metric value (and consequently the Base Score) will be larger the
more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit
the vulnerable component. The assumption is that the number of potential
attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is
larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability
requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater Base
Score. The list of possible values is presented in Table 1.</p>
<p><strong>Table 1: Attack Vector</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Metric Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Network (N)</td>
<td>The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable <em>at the protocol level</em> one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). An example of a network attack is an attacker causing a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted TCP packet across a wide area network (e.g., CVE‑2004‑0230).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adjacent (A)</td>
<td>The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited <em>at the protocol level</em> to a logically adjacent topology. This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone). One example of an Adjacent attack would be an ARP (IPv4) or neighbor discovery (IPv6) flood leading to a denial of service on the local LAN segment (e.g., CVE‑2013‑6014).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Local (L)</td>
<td>The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: <ul><li>the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); <em>or</em></li><li>the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., using social engineering techniques to trick a legitimate user into opening a malicious document).</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Physical (P)</td>
<td>The attack requires the attacker to physically touch or manipulate the vulnerable component. Physical interaction may be brief (e.g., evil maid attack[^1]) or persistent. An example of such an attack is a cold boot attack in which an attacker gains access to disk encryption keys after physically accessing the target system. Other examples include peripheral attacks via FireWire/USB Direct Memory Access (DMA).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>Scoring Guidance</em>: When deciding between Network and Adjacent, if an attack can

<h3 id="2-1-2-Attack-Complexity-AC">2.1.2. Attack Complexity (AC)</h3>
<p>This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must
exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. As described below, such conditions
may require the collection of more information about the target, or
computational exceptions. Importantly, the assessment of this metric excludes
any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability
(such conditions are captured in the User Interaction metric). If a specific
configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be
scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. The Base
Score is greatest for the least complex attacks. The list of possible values is
presented in Table 2.</p>

<td>A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.[^2] For example, a successful attack may depend on an attacker overcoming any of the following conditions:<ul><li>The attacker must gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists. For example, a requirement to collect details on target configuration settings, sequence numbers, or shared secrets.</li><li>The attacker must prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability. For example, repeated exploitation to win a race condition, or overcoming advanced exploit mitigation techniques.</li><li>The attacker must inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack).</li></ul></td>

<h2 id="2-2-Scope-S">2.2. Scope (S)</h2>
<p>The Scope metric captures whether a vulnerability in one vulnerable component
impacts resources in components beyond its <em>security scope</em>.</p>
<p>Formally, a <em>security authority</em> is a mechanism (e.g., an application, an
operating system, firmware, a sandbox environment) that defines and enforces
access control in terms of how certain subjects/actors (e.g., human users,
processes) can access certain restricted objects/resources (e.g., files, CPU,
memory) in a controlled manner. All the subjects and objects under the
jurisdiction of a single <em>security authority</em> are considered to be under one
<em>security scope</em>. If a vulnerability in a vulnerable component can affect a
component which is in a different <em>security scope</em> than the vulnerable
component, a Scope change occurs. Intuitively, whenever the impact of a
vulnerability breaches a security/trust boundary and impacts components outside
the security scope in which vulnerable component resides, a Scope change occurs.</p>
<p>The security scope of a component encompasses other components that provide
functionality solely to that component, even if these other components have
their own security authority. For example, a database used solely by one
application is considered part of that application’s security scope even if the
database has its own security authority, e.g., a mechanism controlling access to
database records based on database users and associated database privileges.</p>
<p>The Base Score is greatest when a scope change occurs. The list of possible
values is presented in Table 5.</p>

<h2 id="2-3-Impact-Metrics">2.3. Impact Metrics</h2>
<p>The Impact metrics capture the effects of a successfully exploited vulnerability
on the component that suffers the worst outcome that is most directly and
predictably associated with the attack. Analysts should constrain impacts to a
reasonable, final outcome which they are confident an attacker is able to
achieve.</p>
<p>Only the increase in access, privileges gained, or other negative outcome as a
result of successful exploitation should be considered when scoring the Impact
metrics of a vulnerability. For example, consider a vulnerability that requires
read-only permissions prior to being able to exploit the vulnerability. After
successful exploitation, the attacker maintains the same level of read access,
and gains write access. In this case, only the Integrity impact metric should be
scored, and the Confidentiality and Availability Impact metrics should be set as
None.</p>
<p>Note that when scoring a delta change in impact, the <strong>final impact</strong> should be
used. For example, if an attacker starts with partial access to restricted
information (Confidentiality Low) and successful exploitation of the
vulnerability results in complete loss in confidentiality (Confidentiality
High), then the resultant CVSS Base Score should reference the “end game” Impact
metric value (Confidentiality High).</p>
<p>If a scope change has not occurred, the Impact metrics should reflect the
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impacts to the vulnerable
component. However, if a scope change has occurred, then the Impact metrics
should reflect the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impacts to
either the vulnerable component, or the impacted component, whichever suffers
the most severe outcome.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-1-Confidentiality-C">2.3.1. Confidentiality (C)</h3>
<p>This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information
resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited
vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and
disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or
disclosure to, unauthorized ones. The Base Score is greatest when the loss to
the impacted component is highest. The list of possible values is presented in
Table 6.</p>

resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality
and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity
of <em>data</em> (e.g., information, files) used by the impacted component, this metric
refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a
networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the
accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth,
processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted
component. The Base Score is greatest when the consequence to the impacted
component is highest. The list of possible values is presented in Table 8.</p>

<h2 id="3-1-Exploit-Code-Maturity-E">3.1. Exploit Code Maturity (E)</h2>
<p>This metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is
typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code
availability, or active, “in-the-wild” exploitation. Public availability of
easy-to-use exploit code increases the number of potential attackers by
including those who are unskilled, thereby increasing the severity of the
vulnerability. Initially, real-world exploitation may only be theoretical.
Publication of proof-of-concept code, functional exploit code, or sufficient
technical details necessary to exploit the vulnerability may follow.
Furthermore, the exploit code available may progress from a proof-of-concept
demonstration to exploit code that is successful in exploiting the vulnerability
consistently. In severe cases, it may be delivered as the payload of a
network-based worm or virus or other automated attack tools.</p>

suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be
certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgment by the
author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is
higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also

<h1 id="Environmental-Metrics">4. Environmental Metrics</h1>
<p>These metrics enable the analyst to customize the CVSS score depending on the
importance of the affected IT asset to a user’s organization, measured in terms
of complementary/alternative security controls in place, Confidentiality,
Integrity, and Availability. The metrics are the modified equivalent of Base
metrics and are assigned values based on the component placement within
organizational infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="4-1-Security-Requirements-CR-IR-AR">4.1. Security Requirements (CR, IR, AR)</h2>
<p>These metrics enable the analyst to customize the CVSS score depending on the
importance of the affected IT asset to a user’s organization, measured in terms
of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. That is, if an IT asset
supports a business function for which Availability is most important, the
analyst can assign a greater value to Availability relative to Confidentiality
and Integrity. Each Security Requirement has three possible values: Low, Medium,
or High.</p>
<p>The full effect on the environmental score is determined by the corresponding
Modified Base Impact metrics. That is, these metrics modify the environmental
score by reweighting the Modified Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
impact metrics. For example, the Modified Confidentiality impact (MC) metric has
increased weight if the Confidentiality Requirement (CR) is High. Likewise, the
Modified Confidentiality impact metric has decreased weight if the
Confidentiality Requirement is Low. The Modified Confidentiality impact metric
weighting is neutral if the Confidentiality Requirement is Medium. This same
process is applied to the Integrity and Availability requirements.</p>
<p>Note that the Confidentiality Requirement will not affect the Environmental
score if the (Modified Base) confidentiality impact is set to None. Also,
increasing the Confidentiality Requirement from Medium to High will not change
the Environmental score when the (Modified Base) impact metrics are set to High.
This is because the Modified Impact Sub-Score (part of the Modified Base Score
that calculates impact) is already at a maximum value of 10.</p>
<p>The list of possible values is presented in Table 12. For brevity, the same
table is used for all three metrics. The greater the Security Requirement, the

<h2 id="4-2-Modified-Base-Metrics">4.2. Modified Base Metrics</h2>
<p>These metrics enable the analyst to override individual Base metrics based on
specific characteristics of a user’s environment. Characteristics that affect
Exploitability, Scope, or Impact can be reflected via an appropriately modified
Environmental Score.</p>
<p>The full effect on the Environmental score is determined by the corresponding
Base metrics. That is, these metrics modify the Environmental Score by
overriding Base metric values, prior to applying the Environmental Security
Requirements. For example, the default configuration for a vulnerable component
may be to run a listening service with administrator privileges, for which a
compromise might grant an attacker Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
impacts that are all High. Yet, in the analyst’s environment, that same Internet
service might be running with reduced privileges; in that case, the Modified
Confidentiality, Modified Integrity, and Modified Availability might each be set
to Low.</p>
<p>For brevity, only the names of the Modified Base metrics are mentioned. Each
Modified Environmental metric has the same values as its corresponding Base
metric, plus a value of Not Defined. Not Defined is the default and uses the
metric value of the associated Base metric.</p>
<p>The intent of this metric is to define the mitigations in place for a given
environment. It is acceptable to use the modified metrics to represent
situations that increase the Base Score. For example, the default configuration
of a component may require high privileges to access a particular function, but
in the analyst’s environment there may be no privileges required. The analyst
can set Privileges Required to High and Modified Privileges Required to None to
reflect this more serious condition in their particular environment.</p>

<h1 id="Vector-String">6. Vector String</h1>
<p>The CVSS v3.1 vector string is a text representation of a set of CVSS metrics.

<p>The CVSS v3.1 vector string begins with the label “CVSS:” and a numeric
representation of the current version, “3.1”. Metric information follows in the
form of a set of metrics, each preceded by a forward slash, “/”, acting as a
delimiter. Each metric is a metric name in abbreviated form, a colon, “:”, and
its associated metric value in abbreviated form. The abbreviated forms are
defined earlier in this specification (in parentheses after each metric name and
metric value), and are summarized in the table below.</p>
<p>A vector string should contain metrics in the order shown in Table 15, though
other orderings are valid. All Base metrics must be included in a vector string.
Temporal and Environmental metrics are optional, and omitted metrics are
considered to have the value of Not Defined (X). Metrics with a value of Not
Defined can be explicitly included in a vector string if desired. Programs
reading CVSS v3.1 vector strings must accept metrics in any order and treat
unspecified Temporal and Environmental as Not Defined. A vector string must not
include the same metric more than once.</p>

Scope: Unchanged, Confidentiality: Low, Integrity: Low, Availability: None” and
no specified Temporal or Environmental metrics would produce the following
vector:</p>
<p><code>CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N</code></p>
<p>The same example with the addition of “Exploitability: Functional, Remediation
Level: Not Defined” and with the metrics in a non-preferred ordering would
produce the following vector:</p>
<p><code>CVSS:3.1/S:U/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:X</code></p>

<h2 id="7-5-A-Word-on-CVSS-v3-1-Equations-and-Scoring">7.5. A Word on CVSS v3.1 Equations and Scoring</h2>
<p>The CVSS v3.1 formula provides a mathematical approximation of all possible
metric combinations ranked in order of severity (a vulnerability lookup table).
To produce the CVSS v3.1 formula, the CVSS Special Interest Group (SIG) framed
the lookup table by assigning metric values to real vulnerabilities, and a
severity group (low, medium, high, critical). Having defined the acceptable
numeric ranges for each severity level, the SIG then collaborated with Deloitte
&amp; Touche LLP to adjust formula parameters in order to align the metric
combinations to the SIG's proposed severity ratings.</p>
<p>Given that there are a limited number of numeric outcomes (101 outcomes, ranging
from 0.0 to 10.0), multiple scoring combinations may produce the same numeric
score. In addition, some numeric scores may be omitted because the weights and
calculations are derived from the severity ranking of metric combinations.
Further, in some cases, metric combinations may deviate from the desired
severity threshold. This is unavoidable and a simple correction is not readily
available because adjustments made to one metric value or equation parameter in
order to fix a deviation, cause other, potentially more severe deviations.</p>
<p>By consensus, and as was done with CVSS v2.0, the acceptable deviation was a
value of 0.5. That is, all the metric value combinations used to derive the
weights and calculation will produce a numeric score within its assigned
severity level, or within 0.5 of that assigned level. For example, a combination
expected to be rated as a “high” may have a numeric score between 6.6 and 9.3.
Finally, CVSS v3.1 retains the range from 0.0 to 10.0 for backward
compatibility.</p>
<h1 id="Appendix-A---Floating-Point-Rounding">Appendix A - Floating Point Rounding</h1>
<p>Simple implementations of the Roundup function defined in Section 7 are likely
to lead to different results across programming languages and hardware
platforms. This is due to small inaccuracies that occur when using floating
point arithmetic. For example, although the intuitive result of <strong>0.1 + 0.2</strong> is
<strong>0.3</strong>, JavaScript implementations on many systems return
<strong>0.30000000000000004</strong>. A simple implementation of Roundup would round this up
to to <strong>0.4</strong>, which is counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>Implementers of CVSS formulas must take steps to avoid these types of problems.
Different techniques may be required for different languages and platforms, and
some may offer standard functionality that minimizes or fully avoids such
problems.</p>
<p>A suggested approach is for the Roundup function to first multiply its input by
100,000 and convert it to the <em>nearest</em> integer. The rounding up should then be
performed using only integer arithmetic, which is not subject to floating point
inaccuracies. An example of pseudocode for such an implementation is:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>function Roundup (input):</code></li>
<li><code>    int_input = round_to_nearest_integer (input * 100000)</code></li>
<li><code>    if (int_input % 10000) == 0:</code></li>
<li><code>        return int_input / 100000.0</code></li>
<li><code>    else:</code></li>
<li><code>        return (floor(int_input / 10000) + 1) / 10.0</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>floor</strong> function on line 6 represents integer division, i.e., the largest
integer value less than or equal to its input. Many programming languages
include a floor function as standard.</p>
<p>Line 3 checks if the least significant four digits of the integer are all
zeroes, e.g., an input of 1.200003 would be converted by line 2 into 120,003,
making the result of the modulo operation 0 and therefore the <em>if</em> statement
condition is <em>true</em>. If <em>true</em>, no additional rounding is required. If <em>false</em>,
the integer is incremented by 0.1 before being returned, though line 6 performs
this on numbers ten times bigger than the result will be in order to use integer
arithmetic.</p>
